# Aim

To demonstrate how different prompt-engineering methods—such as structured decomposition, decision-making prompts, semantic controls, and tail-generation—can be used to create well-organized academic and business content.
This experiment highlights how prompt structure affects clarity, depth, flow, and factual accuracy in AI-generated outputs.

---

# Procedure

## **Step 1 : Understanding Prompt Patterns**

Before generating content, the following prompting techniques were reviewed:

### **Prompt Techniques Used**

* **Query Decomposition** – Break complex subjects into smaller, manageable sections.
* **Decision-Making Prompts** – Ask the model to choose between options to create strategic reasoning.
* **Answer Engineering** – Specify structure, tone, and formatting before generation.
* **Fact-Check List** – Enforce accuracy by adding verification instructions.
* **Tail Generation** – Extend content meaningfully without losing flow.
* **Menu Actions** – Provide multiple paths and let the model choose the most relevant one.
* **Semantic Filtering** – Control tone (formal, academic, concise, etc.).

---

## **Step 2 : Selecting the Content Type**

The content chosen for this experiment:

### **Case Study Topic:**

**Business Success Case Study — “The Rise of Nykaa”**

Focus areas include:

* Digital-first business strategy
* Brand building
* Customer experience innovation
* Omni-channel transformation
